Parallel to the US 2016 election ran a conflict that mainstream media largely overlooked until it surfaced in the form of criticism of the Pepe meme and its association with the increasingly brazen and visible "alt-right". This was only a glimpse into the "Great Meme War" which linked an ideological conflict expressed through memes to an exceptionally contentious US presidential election. After Trump's victory, many participants in the "war" celebrated their success at "electing a meme".

Memes are developing an increasingly important role as a potent form of political propaganda, both solidifying in-group ideological identity and disseminating ideas in forms that are often disarming in their unexpectedness or humor.

The spread of a particular political message doesn't have to be a meme's primary function. They are also strategically deployed to disrupt the unity or discussion of other communities. For example, by presenting a controversial opinion and goading others into arguing against it. The poster has no intention of actually engaging in debate; they just want others to waste time and energy. This usage of memes is more akin to traditional trolling, where the goal is to subtly derail conversations.

Memes are especially effectively used in this way by the alt-right, exploiting liberal impulses of virtue signaling and piggybacking onto the currents of social media outrage culture.

Though the alt-right is perhaps most recognized for politically weaponizing memes, it isn't alone in this usage. There's also a burgeoning scene of communist and other anti-capitalist/leftist memes, such as r/FULLCOMMUNISM.

There are several questions I'm interested in: What is the actual influence of memes on individual political opinions? How are forms of totally apolitical memes appropriated as political messaging? How are ideological arguments made through them? How do conflicts over the control of meme symbolism, as we saw with Pepe, play out? Can memes reliant on recursive irony communicate a cogent political argument?

To gain some insight into these questions I've been collecting political memes on Are.na. There are so many to choose from and so much that more that could be said about each, but here are a few selections.

This form started out from The Political Compass where you could take a quiz and see where you lie in a matrix with the axes economic left vs economic right and authoritarian vs libertarian. The reductiveness of this representation was ripe for ridicule, and generated many variations that are surprisingly way more expressive than the original. Some of these desperately try to create a rigorous and elaborate spatial representation of ideology, others play with the form for criticism and humor. Many of these renderings riff on the perceptions of one quadrant towards the others, mocking all positions and placing the creator outside of the matrix. Others clearly identify with one quadrant more than others.

Anarcho-capitalist memes ("ancap" memes) are dystopian microfictions that depict the absurd extreme of anarcho-capitalism, where unregulated markets completely replace the state. Property reigns supreme, force is privatized, corporations are warlords, and a relationship is only as good as the contract you signed for it. There are other forms of these "life in libertarian paradise" memes, e.g. some exist as 4chan greentexts:

"Increasingly verbose" memes deconstruct a statement into greater and greater detail while the accompanying image dissolves into abstractness. In a political application they provide a way to unpack rhetoric into a less ambiguous form ("what does he mean when he says 'Make America Great Again'?"). Of the memes here this one has the greatest capacity for presenting rational arguments.

Many alt-right memes use a "fascist" aesthetic (<- content warning), evoking a nostalgia of the Roman empire and other imperialistic or militaristic motifs. These references are often channeled through the imagery of the Warhammer 40K universe, where the "Imperium of Man" is embroiled in an endless pan-galactic holy war. This one depicts Trump as the Imperium of Man's "God Emperor" who, according to W40K lore, requires the daily sacrifice of one thousand souls to stay alive. This aesthetic communicates a grand narrative of impossibly-large scale but simultaneously positions its audience as its pivotal actors while casting others as totally expendable.

Comrade Jeb! memes appropriate the image of Jeb(!) Bush, rebranding him as an anti-fascist activist. There's an implied narrative of Jeb radicalizing after the election, where his loss causes him to re-evaluate his politics and join in leftist organizing. It's not clear. But the dissonance these memes generate - a conservative politician advocating for the destruction of the capitalism - can be powerful, especially in those milliseconds where the quote is mistaken for real. If ideas are received or ignored based on who they are coming from, then memes which exploit both the preconceptions audiences have of a speaker (e.g. "Jeb Bush is a conservative, I'm a conservative, so I'll hear what he has to say") and the tendency to, at least at first, believe what we read online can be a potent way of exposing people to new political perspectives.

What is the political effect of memes? Are the ones presented here just vehicles for in-group signaling? Or do they have a real influence on a person's political identity?

There are some meta-memes reflecting on their role in personal political development:

It's not clear how common this narrative is, but glimpses can be caught in the comments of some shitposting communities. In one such community I've witnessed several genuine political discussions, with receptive and open-minded participants, take place on among memes about anxiety and depression, rather than those that are explicitly political.

It's still very early in this informal research, so I don't have any conclusions yet. These memes are constantly being produced, reinvented, and appropriated; if you come across any interesting political memes or analysis, please bring them to the political meme research channel.
